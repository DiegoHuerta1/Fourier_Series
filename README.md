# Fourier_Series
Interactive visualization of complex fourier series


This project provides a graphical interface for visualizing complex Fourier series, which can be customized using various input modes and settings. The user can draw points or delimit them on a canvas, and the program will interpolate the points and compute their Fourier series.
